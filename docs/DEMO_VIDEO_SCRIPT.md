# VerdeScore Demo Video Script
## Hackathon Submission - 3-5 Minute Demo

---

## 🎬 OPENING (0:00 - 0:20)

**[SCREEN: Title card with VerdeScore logo or landing page]**

> "What if we could evaluate green loans 66,000 times faster than traditional methods?
> 
> Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is **VerdeScore** — an AI-powered platform that transforms green loan assessment from a 10-day manual process into instant, explainable decisions."

---

## 📊 THE PROBLEM (0:20 - 1:00)

**[SCREEN: Show statistics or simple graphics]**

> "Here's the challenge facing green finance today:
> 
> The world needs **$7.5 trillion annually** to meet climate goals by 2030. But only $1.3 trillion is currently flowing to green projects.
> 
> Why? Because evaluating a single green loan takes **10 days** on average. It costs banks between $5,000 and $15,000 per evaluation. And human reviewers interpret green criteria inconsistently.
> 
> While analysts sift through documents, climate-critical projects wait months for funding decisions."

---

## 💡 THE SOLUTION (1:00 - 1:30)

**[SCREEN: Show VerdeScore dashboard overview]**

> "VerdeScore solves this with **semantic AI analysis**.
> 
> Unlike keyword matching, our AI actually *understands* green finance. It knows that 'photovoltaic installation' means the same thing as 'solar panel project.'
> 
> We automatically check compliance against **LMA Green Loan Principles** and **EU Taxonomy criteria** — the two major regulatory frameworks governing sustainable finance."

---

## 🎯 LIVE DEMO (1:30 - 3:30)

### Part 1: Submit a Loan Application

**[SCREEN: Navigate to the Loan Submission page]**

> "Let me show you how it works. I'll submit a real loan application."

**[ACTION: Fill in the form or show pre-filled data]**

> "Here's a €5 million solar project proposal. I'll enter the applicant name, amount, and the project description with environmental claims."

**[ACTION: Click Submit]**

> "Watch the processing time in the corner..."

---

### Part 2: Instant AI Analysis

**[SCREEN: Results appear with green score, recommendation]**

> "**13 milliseconds.** That's all it took.
> 
> The AI assigned a **Green Score of 87** — meaning this project strongly aligns with sustainable finance criteria.
> 
> Notice the compliance badges: **LMA GLP Compliant** and **EU Taxonomy Eligible**. These aren't guesses — they're based on the actual regulatory frameworks."

---

### Part 3: Explainable AI

**[SCREEN: Click on the loan to show detailed view or explainability panel]**

> "But here's what makes VerdeScore special — **explainability**.
> 
> Every score comes with a full breakdown:
> - **Semantic Score**: How well does this project match our 9 green categories?
> - **Impact Score**: Did they provide quantified environmental claims?
> - **Compliance Score**: How many LMA principles are met?
> 
> The AI also explains its reasoning in plain English — no black box decisions."

---

### Part 4: Portfolio Dashboard

**[SCREEN: Navigate to Dashboard showing multiple loans]**

> "Banks don't evaluate one loan at a time. They process thousands.
> 
> Our dashboard shows the entire portfolio at a glance — filtering by status, sorting by green score, tracking approval rates.
> 
> Every decision has a complete **audit trail** for regulatory compliance."

## ⚡ THE IMPACT (3:30 - 4:00)

**[SCREEN: Show impact statistics or comparison graphic]**

> "Let's talk impact:
> 
> - **Speed**: 66,000 times faster than manual review
> - **Consistency**: Same criteria applied to every application
> - **Transparency**: Full explainability for regulators and applicants
> - **Scale**: One analyst can now process 500,000 loans per year instead of 500
> 
> If 100 banks adopted VerdeScore, we could accelerate **$50 billion** in green financing annually."

---

## 🛠️ TECHNOLOGY (4:00 - 4:30)

**[SCREEN: Optional - show architecture diagram or code snippet]**

> "Under the hood, VerdeScore uses:
> 
> - **DeepSeek API** for semantic embeddings and AI reasoning
> - **Cosine similarity matching** against 9 curated green categories
> - Automated compliance checking against **real EU Taxonomy thresholds**
> - Full audit logging for **Article 8 disclosure** requirements
> 
> The entire system runs as a monorepo deployed on Railway — one command to deploy."

## 🎬 CLOSING (4:30 - 5:00)

**[SCREEN: Return to landing page or show URL]**

> "VerdeScore transforms green finance from bottleneck to breakthrough.
> 
> From 10 days to 13 milliseconds.  
> From guesswork to explainable AI.  
> From inconsistent to compliant.
> 
> Try it live at **verdescore-production.up.railway.app**
> 
> Thank you for watching. Let's accelerate the green transition together."
